# Smart Canteen Management System

## Project Overview
The Smart Canteen Management System is a robust solution designed to modernize and streamline the operations of cafeterias. By integrating modern technologies, this system improves the overall customer experience while optimizing the management processes. This system automates key processes, including food ordering, payment, inventory management, and reporting, creating a seamless interaction between customers and cafeteria management.

## Features:

### Automated Ordering
- **User Interface:** Customers can easily browse through the menu and place orders digitally, reducing the wait time and errors that typically occur in manual ordering processes.
- **Order Customization:** Users can customize their food orders based on available options (e.g., toppings, spice levels).
- **Real-Time Updates:** Customers can track the status of their orders in real-time via a mobile app or a website.

### Payment Integration
- **Secure Payment Gateway:** Integrates with reliable online payment systems (e.g., credit/debit cards, digital wallets) to ensure secure transactions.
- **Cashless Transactions:** Reduces the need for physical cash and speeds up the payment process.
- **Receipt Generation:** Provides an electronic receipt for every transaction, ensuring transparency and ease of access.

### Inventory Management
- **Stock Monitoring:** Continuously monitors stock levels of food ingredients and supplies in real-time.
- **Automatic Reordering:** Automatically places orders for inventory when stock levels fall below a pre-defined threshold.
- **Expiry Tracking:** Tracks the expiration dates of perishable goods to minimize wastage.

### User Management
- **Account Management:** Users can create and manage personal accounts, view their order history, and track loyalty points.
- **Loyalty Programs:** Rewards repeat customers with discounts, points, or exclusive offers.
- **User Roles:** Admin, staff, and customers have different levels of access to the system, allowing for effective management.

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Sales Reports:** Generates daily, weekly, and monthly sales reports to help cafeteria managers analyze performance.
- **Inventory Reports:** Provides insights into stock usage and reorder schedules to optimize inventory levels.
- **User Behavior Analytics:** Tracks customer preferences and behaviors to optimize the menu and improve customer experience.

### Notification System
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Customers receive updates about their order status, promotions, and special offers.
- **Admin Alerts:** Managers are notified about low inventory, high-demand items, or issues related to food orders.

### System Security
- **SSL/TLS Encryption:** All sensitive data, such as payment details and user information, are protected through SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring safe transactions and data storage.
- **User Authentication:** Secure login mechanisms to authenticate users and restrict unauthorized access to the system.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data to prevent loss in case of system failure.
